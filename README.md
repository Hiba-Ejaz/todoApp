## Requirements
 an HTML file with a form and a table that will display the list of tasks. Each row in the table will represent a to do task and will contain input fields for the title, deadline, and status of the task.

a function in JavaScript validates the user's input for the title. The function  checks that the title is not empty and that it does not already exist in the table. If the title is not unique or empty, entire item should not be added to the table.

a delete button to each row in the table. When a user clicks the delete button, the entire row is removed from the table.

there is an update button to each row in the table. When a user clicks the update button followed by submit button after changing fields, the task details in that row should be updated and the changes should be saved to the table.

Used SCSS to style the table and its components, including the input fields, delete button, and update button.

Tested to ensure that it works as intended.
